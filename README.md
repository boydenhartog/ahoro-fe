In order to be able to call the Fixer api (used to retrieve currencies), you need an api key.
Create one for free here https://fixer.io/documentation

Then, create a .env file in the root of the project with the following vars:

    FIXER_API_KEY=your_key
    FIXER_API_URL=http://data.fixer.io/api


To do list:

- Homepage overhaul
    - Create fancy graphs/stats
    - Replace placeholders

- React navigation
    - Add screens
    - Style topbar
    
- Hook up form to redux
- Branding

As long as I'm hosting the app locally, you can view it on expo here:
